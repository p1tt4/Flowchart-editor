# Simple Flow Editor

Several months ago I was writing a small tutotorial and that required me to draw diagrams and charts to better explain some concepts, so I spent some time looking for an editor that would help to accomplish this task, and I found some good valid choices, but they were all lacking of a minor functionality, that would make them suitable for my case. For instance one of those editors would not allow me to save the outcome SVG file. 

In addition to that, to operate I had to switch among those tools because they were unrealated. So after half day I decided to aggregate them, which somehow meant to create a new instrument. It is not a super fancy editor and has a limited capability. Neverthless being it open source you can modify and enhance it at your own disposal. 

The two editors are relatively simple to use. From the browser navigate to the folder where the ```index.html``` file is located, open it and then start coding. The relatively syntax of each diagram is shown at the bottom part of ```index.html``` page. No extenal imports are performed, so once you cloned the repository you can also work offline.
